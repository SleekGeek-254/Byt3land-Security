This React-based web application showcases a simple lattice-based encryption system. Users can input a message, encrypt it using LWE-based encryption, and then decrypt it using both correct and incorrect keys to demonstrate the system's functionality.

## Features

- Message encryption using lattice-based cryptography
- Message decryption with correct and incorrect keys
- Real-time display of encryption and decryption times
- Secure random number generation using Web Crypto API
- Constant-time discrete Gaussian sampling

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/lattice-encryption-demo.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```
   cd lattice-encryption-demo
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

4. Start the development server:
   ```
   npm start
   ```


5. Open your browser and visit `http://localhost:3000`

## Usage

1. Enter a message in the input field.
2. Click the "Encrypt" button to encrypt the message.
3. View the encrypted message and decryption results.
4. Observe the encryption and decryption times for performance analysis.

## Security Analysis

While this project demonstrates the basic principles of lattice-based cryptography, it is not suitable for production use due to several security considerations:

### Strengths

- Use of quantum-resistant lattice-based cryptography
- Secure random number generation via Web Crypto API
- Implementation of constant-time discrete Gaussian sampling
- Basic padding implementation

### Areas for Improvement

1. **Parameter Selection**: Current parameters (q, n, m, indice) need careful analysis to ensure sufficient security.
2. **Error Distribution**: Fixed sigma value for Gaussian distribution may not be optimal.
3. **Message Encoding**: Current binary encoding might leak information about message structure.
4. **Lack of Authentication**: No integrity checking, vulnerable to malleability attacks.
5. **Key Reuse**: No mechanism to prevent key reuse.
6. **Potential Side-Channel Vulnerabilities**: Some operations may not be constant-time.
7. **Error Handling**: Lacks robust error handling for unexpected inputs.
8. **Frontend Exposure**: Cryptographic operations in frontend are vulnerable to tampering.

## Additional Findings

- **Performance Considerations**: The current implementation may not be optimized for large-scale use. Performance bottlenecks were observed in matrix operations and Gaussian sampling for larger parameter sets.
- **Browser Compatibility**: The Web Crypto API usage may limit compatibility with older browsers. Consider implementing fallbacks for broader support.
- **Memory Usage**: Large matrix operations can be memory-intensive. Future optimizations should consider memory management for resource-constrained devices.

## Future Implementations

1. **Improved Parameter Selection**: Implement a module for dynamic, security-level-based parameter selection.
2. **Advanced Message Encoding**: Develop a more secure method of encoding messages, possibly incorporating error-correcting codes.
3. **Authentication Mechanism**: Integrate a lattice-based signature scheme or MAC for message integrity and authenticity.
4. **Key Management System**: Design and implement a robust key generation, storage, and rotation system.
5. **Side-Channel Resistance**: Conduct a thorough review and optimize all operations for constant-time execution.
6. **Error Handling Framework**: Develop a comprehensive error checking and handling system throughout the codebase.
7. **Backend Integration**: Move core cryptographic operations to a secure backend, leaving only necessary operations client-side.
8. **Hybrid Encryption Scheme**: Implement a hybrid encryption scheme combining symmetric and lattice-based asymmetric encryption for improved efficiency with large messages.
9. **Benchmark Suite**: Develop a comprehensive benchmark suite to measure and compare performance across different parameter sets and optimizations.
10. **Educational Visualizations**: Create interactive visualizations to help users understand the underlying mathematical concepts of lattice-based cryptography.
